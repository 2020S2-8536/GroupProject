Demo

1. cd tools

2. Run demo_visualize.m to see how to visualize bbox annotations.


Annotation File

1. anno_bbox.mat contains three variables:
    a. bbox_train: bounding boxes annotation for the train2015 set

        filename: file names
        size:     image width, hieght, depth
        hoi:      HOI annotations
            id:          action index of list_action
            bboxhuman:   human bounding boxes
            bboxobject:  object bounding boxes
            connection:  instances of HOI (human-object pairs); each row is
                         one instance, represented by a pair of human bbox
                         index and object bbox index
            invis:       1: HOI invisible; bboxhuman/bboxobject/connection
                            will be empty
                         0: HOI visible; bboxhuman/bboxobject/connection
                            will not be empty

    b. bbox_test: bounding boxes annotation for the test2015 set; same 
                  stucture as bbox_train

    c. list_action: list of HOIs
